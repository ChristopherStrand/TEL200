\section{Introduction}
Industrial robotics plays an increasingly vital role in enhancing productivity, precision, and efficiency within modern manufacturing processes. ABB RobotStudio and RAPID provides a powerful platform for simulating and optimizing robotic operations in a virtual environment prior to physical implementation.

In this project, we use ABB's RobotStudio simulation environment to develop, simulate, and deploy two different applications as described in the task description. 

The first application involves precisely picking up objects and moving them to another designated location at the click of a button, with additional safety functionality integrated through an emergency button.

The second application is the YuMi challenge where we were given an open task to test the capabilities of the YuMi robot. Inspired by the 18th century famous machine that fascinated audiences across Europe, "The Turk". As The Turk, we won´t either play fully autonomous and will use scholar´s mate to make it possible to finish within the given time frame. This  will provide an understanding of the functionality of YuMi robot and it´s capabilities doing precise tasks.

The report provides detailed insights into the methods, procedures, and results achieved through these applications, emphasizing practical experiences and theoretical connections drawn from the course syllabus.

\subsection{Theory}
To understad the motion of a robotarm it´s important to understand some key concepts.

To create our CAD geometry we used a 3D-scanner borrowed from Eiklab to make a 3D object of each type of chess piece. We then imported each 3D file into Fusion360 where we performed the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mesh $\rightarrow$ Insert $\rightarrow$ Insert Mesh
    \item Rotated the chess pieces such that they are straight
    \item Exported them as .sat files
\end{enumerate}
We then imported the .sat files to Robotstudio using the import CAD geometry button. To be continued
